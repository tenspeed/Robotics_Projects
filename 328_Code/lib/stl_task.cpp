/** \file stl_task.cpp
 *    This file contains the definition of a task class. This class implements the
 *    tasks in a multitasking system. These tasks are intended to be run in a 
 *    cooperative multitasking framework, but they can also be worked into an 
 *    interrupt framework or run within an RTOS. 
 * 
 *  Revisions
 *    \li 04-21-2007 JRR Original copy of this file, derived from UCB's TranRun4 and
 *                       simplified greatly for efficient use in AVR processors
 *    \li 05-07-2007 JRR Small bug fixes
 *    \li 06-01-2008 JRR Changed debugging/trace to take advantage of base_text_serial
 *    \li 06-03-2008 JRR Cleaned up comments, got rid of Doxygen warnings
 *    \li 12-19-2009 JRR Integrated simple execution time profiling into file, changed
 *                       from *.cc to *.cpp, and set up for global serial debugging
