Robotics_Projects
=================
This repository contains all my robotics related C++ code.

The ME 405 Termproject directory contains all of the code I wrote in college for my mechatronics term project;
a 2.5 degree of freedom polar plotter. This code was written for the Atmega 128 and Atmega 164 microcontrollers.
Documentation for the Atmega 128 code is located in the html and latex directories.

The Xiphos directory contains all of the code I'm working on for my current robtics project; a 6 degree of freedom
robotic arm. The Xiphos board is a custom PCB created by Cal Poly student Darren Baida. It has an Atmega 1281
microcontroller, two VNH3SP30 H-bridges to control up to two DC motors, and a 16x2 LCD display, among other features
which I won't go into here. It should be pretty similar to an Arduino board.
