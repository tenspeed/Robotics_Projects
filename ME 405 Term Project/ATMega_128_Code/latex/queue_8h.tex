\subsection{Detailed Description}
This file implements a simple queue (or circular buffer). Data which is placed in the queue is saved for future reading. The queue class is implemented as a template; this means that a queue can be configured to store data of almost any type.

Usage\-: The template specifies the type of data being stored as q\-Type, the type of integer used for the index as q\-Index\-Type, and the number of data items in the queue as q\-Size. First choose the type of data being stored; this may be simple data types such as characters or integers, but it may also be something more complex such as objects of a class (if there's enough memory to hold them all). Then look at the number of items in the queue. If there are less than 255, use a character as q\-Index\-Type; otherwise use a regular 16-\/bit integer. For example, a queue holding 100 long integers (which would use 400 bytes for the data plus a few more bytes for the indices) could be declared as \char`\"{}queue$<$long, char, 100$>$ my\-\_\-queue\char`\"{}.
