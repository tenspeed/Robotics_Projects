\subsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains a class which allows the use of a serial port on an A\-V\-R microcontroller. This version of the class uses the serial port receiver interrupt and a buffer to allow characters to be received in the background. The port is used in \char`\"{}text mode\char`\"{}; that is, the information which is sent and received is expected to be plain A\-S\-C\-I\-I text, and the set of overloaded left-\/shift operators \char`\"{}$<$$<$\char`\"{} in \hyperlink{classbase__text__serial}{base\-\_\-text\-\_\-serial}.$\ast$ can be used to easily send all sorts of data to the serial port in a manner similar to iostreams (like \char`\"{}cout\char`\"{}) in regular C++.

Revised\-: \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 04-\/03-\/2006 J\-R\-R For updated version of compiler \item 06-\/10-\/2006 J\-R\-R Ported from C++ to C for use with some C-\/only projects; also serial\-\_\-avr.\-h now has defines for compatibility among lots of A\-V\-R variants \item 08-\/11-\/2006 J\-R\-R Some bug fixes \item 03-\/02-\/2007 J\-R\-R Ported back to C++. I've had it with the limitations of C. \item 04-\/16-\/2007 J\-O Added write (unsigned long) \item 07-\/19-\/2007 J\-R\-R Changed some character return values to bool, added m324p \item 01-\/12-\/2008 J\-R\-R Added code for the A\-Tmega128 using U\-S\-A\-R\-T number 1 only \item 02-\/14-\/2008 J\-R\-R Split between \hyperlink{classbase__text__serial}{base\-\_\-text\-\_\-serial} and \hyperlink{classrs232}{rs232} files \item 05-\/31-\/2008 J\-R\-R Changed baud calculations to use C\-P\-U\-\_\-\-F\-R\-E\-Q\-\_\-\-M\-Hz from Makefile \item 06-\/01-\/2008 J\-R\-R Added getch\-\_\-tout() because it's needed by 9\-Xstream modems \item 07-\/05-\/2008 J\-R\-R Changed from 1 to 2 stop bits to placate finicky receivers \item 12-\/22-\/2008 J\-R\-R Split off stuff in \hyperlink{base232_8h}{base232.\-h} for efficiency \item 06-\/30-\/2009 J\-R\-R Received data interrupt and buffer added\end{DoxyItemize}
