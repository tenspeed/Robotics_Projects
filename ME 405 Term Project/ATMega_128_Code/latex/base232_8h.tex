\subsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains a set of macros which are used by several classes and class templates that interact with the asynchronous (R\-S-\/232 style) serial port on an A\-V\-R microcontroller. Classes which use this stuff include \hyperlink{classrs232}{rs232} and packet232.

Revisions\-: \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 04-\/03-\/2006 J\-R\-R For updated version of compiler \item 06-\/10-\/2006 J\-R\-R Ported from C++ to C for use with some C-\/only projects; also serial\-\_\-avr.\-h now has defines for compatibility among lots of A\-V\-R variants \item 08-\/11-\/2006 J\-R\-R Some bug fixes \item 03-\/02-\/2007 J\-R\-R Ported back to C++. I've had it with the limitations of C. \item 04-\/16-\/2007 J\-O Added write (unsigned long) \item 07-\/19-\/2007 J\-R\-R Changed some character return values to bool, added m324p \item 01-\/12-\/2008 J\-R\-R Added code for the A\-Tmega128 using U\-S\-A\-R\-T number 1 only \item 02-\/14-\/2008 J\-R\-R Split between \hyperlink{classbase__text__serial}{base\-\_\-text\-\_\-serial} and \hyperlink{classrs232}{rs232} files \item 05-\/31-\/2008 J\-R\-R Changed baud calculations to use C\-P\-U\-\_\-\-F\-R\-E\-Q\-\_\-\-M\-Hz from Makefile \item 06-\/01-\/2008 J\-R\-R Added getch\-\_\-tout() because it's needed by 9\-Xstream modems \item 07-\/05-\/2008 J\-R\-R Changed from 1 to 2 stop bits to placate finicky receivers \item 12-\/22-\/2008 J\-R\-R Split off stuff in \hyperlink{base232_8h}{base232.\-h} for efficiency \item 01-\/30-\/2009 J\-R\-R Added class with port setup in constructor \item 06-\/02-\/2009 J\-R\-R Changed baud rate divisor formula to work better \item 12-\/14-\/2009 J\-R\-R Changed C\-P\-U\-\_\-\-F\-R\-E\-Q\-\_\-\-Hz to F\-\_\-\-C\-P\-U to be compatible with avr-\/libc\end{DoxyItemize}

This macro computes a value for the baud rate divisor from the desired baud rate and the C\-P\-U clock frequency. The C\-P\-U clock frequency should have been set in the macro F\-\_\-\-C\-P\-U, which is normally configured in the Makefile. The divisor is calculated as (frequency, M\-Hz / (16 $\ast$ baudrate)), unless the U\-S\-A\-R\-T is running in double-\/speed mode, in which case the baud rate divisor is twice as big.

If this macro is defined, the U\-A\-R\-T will run in double-\/speed mode. This is often a good idea, as it allows higher baud rates to be used with not so high C\-P\-U clock frequencies.
