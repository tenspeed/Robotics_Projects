/** \file  da_motor.cpp
 *    da_motor.cpp is an object class that contains a constructor and three methods which 
 *	  control a motor(s). The constructor initializes timers, prescalars and configures 
 *    necessary i/o ports. Two of the three methods are mirror images of each other and  
 *	  are used to increase/decrease rotational speed. The final method sets the H bridge 
 *    to achieve proper rotational direction and braking.
 *
 *  Revisions:
 *            \li  04-12-11  Began tearing and hacking at our lab_2 code.
 *	          \li  04-18-11  Final iteration. This code is the bestest.
